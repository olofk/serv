Servant : FPGA Reference platform
=================================

   Servant FPGA Reference platform

SERV comes with a small FPGA-focused reference platform called Servant, which is capable of running Zephyr RTOS, the regression test suite and other software. The platform consists of SERV, a timer, memory and a 1-bit GPIO output pin.

Available targets
-----------------

The servant SoC has been ported to an increasing number of different FPGA boards and is easy to modify for new targets. To see all currently supported targets run:

    fusesoc core show servant

By default, these targets have the program memory preloaded with a small Zephyr hello world example that writes its output on a UART pin. Don't forget to install the appropriate toolchain (e.g. icestorm, Vivado, Quartus...) and add to your PATH

Some targets also depend on functionality in the FuseSoC base library (fusesoc-cores). Running `fusesoc library list` should tell you if fusesoc-cores is already available. If not, add it to your workspace with

    fusesoc library add fusesoc-cores https://github.com/fusesoc/fusesoc-cores

Now we're ready to build. Note, for all the cases below, it's possible to run with `--memfile=$SERV/sw/blinky.hex`
(or any other suitable program) as the last argument to preload the LED blink example
instead of hello world.

Porting Servant to a new target
-------------------------------

Mostly any FPGA board can be used to run the Servant SoC. In its simplest form it just needs an FPGA with a clock input and an output that can be used to connect an UART or a LED.

The porting process consists of FIXME steps.
We will use `<name>` as a placeholder for the name of the FPGA board.
1. Locate the pins used for clock input and for the outputs. Outputs should preferably be both a LED and an UART, but either works if not both are available. Optionally, locate an input pin connected to the reset as well. This is not required, but can be handy.
2. Write a pin constraints file with your located pins in the format of the FPGA toolchain you intend to use. For Vivado this would be an .xdc file. For Quartus a .tcl file, for nextpnr a .pcf file and so on. Save this as `data/<name>.{pcf,ucf,xdc...}` in the SERV repo.
3. Create a clock generation file
4. Create a top-level
5. Create a fileset
6. Create a target
